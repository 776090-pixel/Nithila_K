# First Reflection

## What I learned this week:
For my unit 4 project I worked on animating objects in processing, using arrays, and creating a working game using the key pressed function.

## Topic(s):
The topics for this project were to animate objets to fall, using arrays to make multiple objects fall, and using the key pressed function to move characters left and right. This was then overall used to create a game where the main focus is to avoid objects.

## What I struggled with:
I struggled with some bugs in the animation of the game. Sometimes some objects would not fall and it would reset all of them instead of falling smoothly. 

## What I’m proud of:
I am proud of finishing the project in time and using the key pressed function to move the character while using the constraints of the canvas. I'm also proud of figuring out how to properly decrement lives during the game.

## Next steps:
The next steps would be to make the game run more smoothly to ensure that all the objects are falling and not randomly getting removed. Also to focus on making the quality better without small glitches that may impact the gameplay.
