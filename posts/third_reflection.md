# Reflection 3
## What I learned this week:
I learned to use readers to read from a file and replace certain parts of a string using specific commands.

## Topic(s): 
The topic of this assignment was to write code for a given prompt in an hour and fifteen minutes. The prompt had required us to encrypt a list of passwords from a file, as well as give the number of passwords in the list and how many had less than 5 characters.

## What I struggled with: 
I struggled with printing the original line as well as the knew line. Everytime I ran my code it would only show some of the original passwords and some of the encrypted ones. I later found out the reason for the issue had been an original line of code that had not been deleted properly, so after refreshing it worked fine. Looking for the issue had taken a lot of time which had caused me to panic.

## What I’m proud of:
I am proud of the overall code. I did really well with organizing with comments and avoid unneccessary lines of code. The code worked really well and I managed to finish in time and I am glad that I understood what I was doing.

## Next steps: 
My next steps would be to understand how to manage my time when I cannot find a specific error. Instead of assuming something went wrong on my part, refreshing would allow me to also check for glitches within the app itself. I need to work on spending my time so that I am not stuck on one part.
