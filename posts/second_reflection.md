# Reflection 2
What I learned this week:
This week I learned to use different functions and methods to create a nameplate. I also learned how to experiment with functions such as the rotate function.
Topic(s): The topic for our name plate was to use different shapes, colours, and functions to write out our name and add at least 3 images of things that represent ourselves. I decided to do some of my interests and things I like.
What I struggled with: I struggled with using the rotate function since it required more steps than just using the rotate function to ensure that it would rotate properly. It ended up not working out and I ran out of time. I also struggled with using the code to make certain shapes and finish making them in time.
What Iâ€™m proud of: I am proud of the accuracy of the placement of letters and the objects as well as the aesthetic of the nameplate. I was able to keep most of the shapes accurate to the grid of the original paper copy and I managed to use the scale functions. I was also able to use tbe methods which also included parameters in some case.
Next steps: My next steps would be learning to use the rotate function and making a more complex design. I also need to try to finish more of the deisgn next time by planning accordingly and not wasting time trying to figure out things I am stuck on.
